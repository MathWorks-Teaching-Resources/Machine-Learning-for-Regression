# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach the basics of machine learning for regression.

<a name="H_F00D98E4"></a>
## Background

You can use these live scripts as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. This module covers the difference between regression, classification, and clustering, as well as feature engineering and feature extraction, overfitting and underfitting, and a variety of machine learning models commonly used for regression. It also includes a detailed example of applying regression models for electricity load forecasting using real-world data.


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/image_0.png" width="19" alt="image_0.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Contact Us

Solutions are available upon instructor request. Contact the [MathWorks teaching resources team](mailto:onlineteaching@mathworks.com) if you would like to request solutions, provide feedback, or if you have a question.

## Suggested Prework ## 
[MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted)—a free two-hour introductory tutorial to learn the essentials of MATLAB®. Additional programming skills (see [MATLAB Fundamentals](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-fundamentals/mlbe)) are beneficial, but not assumed in the tasks and instructions.  
[Regression Basics](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/93435-regression-basics)—a curriculum module to cover the fundamentals of regression analyis.  

No prior exposure to the subject of machine learning is assumed.    

## Details ##
**`machineLearningIntro.mlx`** [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Machine-Learning-for-Regression&project=MLforRegression.prj&file=machineLearningIntro.mlx)
An interactive lesson that introduces some key concepts in machine learning, along with a few regression models. It contains many independent introductory sections that are easy to edit.

**Learning Goals**
- State the difference between regression, classification, and clustering problems.  
- Outline the common steps involved in applying machine learning techniques.
- Define feature engineering and feature extraction.
- Formulate regression as a machine learning problem.
- Identify and use the different machine learning models commonly used for regression.
- Explain overfitting and underfitting in machine learning, and identify at least two ways of tackling these problems.  

## ##
**`loadForecastRegression.mlx`, `loadForecastRegression_soln.mlx`** [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Machine-Learning-for-Regression&project=MLforRegression.prj&file=loadForecastRegression.mlx)  
Students are guided through the steps to apply machine learning for electricity load forecasting using real-world data. This script can be used in two different modes: controls-only or with complete code.

**Learning Goals**
- Apply the steps in the machine learning workflow to solve a practical problem in time series forecasting.
- Formulate the time series forecasting problem as a machine learning problem by engineering appropriate features.
- Validate and compare different types of regression models.
- Test and evaluate the trained model to make predictions.  

## ##
**`electricityLoadDataML.mlx`** [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Machine-Learning-for-Regression&project=MLforRegression.prj&file=electricityLoadDataML.mlx)  
A supplementary script to download the external electricity load data from [New York ISO](http://mis.nyiso.com/public/) for use in `loadForecastRegression.mlx`. This script contains the code for downloading, organizing, formatting, and cleaning up the raw data.  

## ##
**`FE1_programmaticML.mlx`, `FE2_loadForecastDL.mlx`** [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Machine-Learning-for-Regression&project=MLforRegression.prj&file=FE1_programmaticML.mlx)  
These two scripts contain ideas to expand on the practical problem presented in `loadForecastRegression.mlx`. Working through the suggestions requires some independent exploration and active learning. `FE1_programmaticML.mlx` encourages students to write their own machine learning algorithm, and `FE2_loadForecastDL.mlx` begins to explore deep learning for load forecasting.
